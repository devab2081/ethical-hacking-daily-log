# Networking Basics – Simple Explanation (Day 02)

This file explains networking basics in a simple way for beginners.

## What is Networking?
Networking means connecting two or more devices so they can share data.
Examples include computers, phones, servers, and routers.

## What is an IP Address?
An IP address is a unique number given to each device on a network.
It helps devices find and communicate with each other.

## What are Ports?
Ports are used to identify specific services running on a device.
For example:
- Web service uses a port
- Email service uses a different port

## What are Protocols?
Protocols are rules that define how data is sent and received.
They ensure communication happens correctly.

## TCP vs UDP (Basic)
- TCP ensures data is delivered correctly and in order.
- UDP sends data faster but does not check if it arrives.

## Why Networking is Important for Security
All hacking attacks and defenses happen through networks.
Understanding networking helps in finding and fixing security issues.
