##  Date  
21-12-2025  

##  Topics Learned  
- What SQL Injection is  
- Why SQL Injection happens  
- Impact of SQL Injection  
- Importance of input validation  

##  Tools / Platforms Used  
- Security articles  
- OWASP documentation (theory)  

##  What I Learned Today  

Today I learned about SQL Injection at a conceptual level.  
SQL Injection happens when user input is directly used in database queries without proper validation.

I understood that attackers can manipulate inputs to change how queries behave.  
This can lead to unauthorized access to data or bypassing authentication.

The main reason SQL Injection happens is trusting user input without checks.  
Proper validation and secure coding practices can prevent this issue.

##  Key Takeaways  
- SQL Injection is a serious web vulnerability  
- Input validation is very important  
- Secure database queries prevent attacks  
- Many SQL Injection issues are avoidable
