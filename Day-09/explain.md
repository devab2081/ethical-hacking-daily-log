# Authentication & Session Management – Simple Explanation (Day 09)

## What is Authentication?
Authentication is the process of confirming who a user is.
It usually happens during login.

## What is Authorization?
Authorization decides what a user can access after logging in.
For example, admin users may have more permissions than normal users.

## What is a Session?
A session is a way to remember a logged-in user.
The server uses session data to identify the user for future requests.

## Why is Session Security Important?
If an attacker gets access to a user’s session, they may act as that user.
Proper session handling helps protect user accounts.

## Why Students Should Learn This
Authentication and session issues are very common in real-world web applications.
Understanding them helps in building and testing secure systems.
