##  What I Learned Today  

Today I learned about Cross Site Scripting (XSS).  
XSS happens when a website displays user input without proper filtering or encoding.

I understood that attackers can inject scripts that run in a user’s browser.  
This can lead to session theft or unauthorized actions.

The main reason for XSS is improper handling of user input and output.  
Using proper encoding and validation helps prevent XSS.

##  Key Takeaways  
- XSS affects users, not servers  
- User input must be handled carefully  
- Output encoding is important  
- XSS is a common web vulnerability
