- What requests and responses are  
- Why HTTPS is important  

##  Tools / Platforms Used  
- Browser (developer tools – overview)

##  What I Learned Today  

Today I learned the basics of how websites communicate with users.  
When a user opens a website, the browser sends a request and the server sends back a response.

I learned that HTTP is a protocol used for communication between the browser and the server.  
HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP and uses encryption to protect data.

I understood that HTTPS is important because it protects sensitive data such as login details and personal information.  
Without HTTPS, data can be intercepted during transmission.

Web basics are very important for ethical hacking because most attacks target web applications.

##  Key Takeaways  
- Websites work using requests and responses  
- HTTP is not secure by default  
- HTTPS protects data using encryption  
- Web knowledge is essential for security
