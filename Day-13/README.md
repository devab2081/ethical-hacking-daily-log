## 🧠 What I Learned Today  

Today I learned about security testing methodologies.  
A security testing methodology is a structured approach used to test the security of systems and applications.

I understood that following a methodology helps testers avoid missing important steps.  
Instead of randomly testing, a methodology provides a clear order and direction.

I learned that most security testing methodologies follow common phases such as planning, testing, analysis, and reporting.  
This makes the testing process more organized and reliable.

Security testing methodologies are important because they ensure consistency and repeatability in testing.
